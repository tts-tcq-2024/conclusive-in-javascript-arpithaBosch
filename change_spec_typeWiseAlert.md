# Change Specification Document

**Project**: Typewise Battery Temperature Monitoring System  
**Purpose**: Document the improvements made to enhance readability, maintainability, performance, and robustness.

## 1. Refactoring Summary

### Objective
To improve the code quality of the Battery Temperature Monitoring System by addressing high cyclomatic complexity, lack of modularity, error handling issues, and low test coverage. The goal is to make the code more modular, easily testable, and future-proof for adding new features.

### Key Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity (CCN)**: Reduced to â‰¤3 for each function.
- **Code Coverage**: Increased to >90% statement coverage.
- **Error Handling**: Improved handling for unknown input values and conditions.
- **Modularity**: Code split into smaller, focused modules for better readability and reusability.

## 2. Changes Implemented

### 2.1 Cyclomatic Complexity Reduction

**Problem**  
The original code had a high cyclomatic complexity (CCN >5) in several functions due to nested conditionals and multiple responsibilities within a single function.

**Solution**  
- **Refactored Functions**: Separated the `checkAndAlert`, `sendAlert`, and `classifyTemperatureBreach` functions into smaller, single-responsibility functions.
- **Result**: Each function now has a CCN of 3 or less, improving readability and making each function easier to test and maintain.

### 2.2 Code Coverage Improvements

**Problem**  
The initial test coverage was low, making the system prone to undetected bugs.

**Solution**  
- **Added Test Cases**: Increased coverage by creating specific test cases for each function, including edge cases for temperature limits, invalid inputs, and unknown alert targets.
- **Coverage Results**:
  - Overall statement coverage: **>90%**
  - Branch coverage: Improved significantly by adding tests for each conditional path.

### 2.3 Enhanced Error Handling

**Problem**  
The code did not handle unknown cooling types or alert targets, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

**Solution**  
- **Implemented Error Handling**:
  - Added error checks in `getTemperatureLimits` to throw an error for unknown cooling types.
  - Modified `sendAlert` to handle unknown alert targets by throwing a clear, descriptive error.
- **Result**: Reduced risk of runtime errors and improved robustness.

### 2.4 Improved Modularity and Separation of Concerns

**Problem**  
The code was monolithic, with tightly coupled functions that made it difficult to add new features or isolate functionality.

**Solution**  
- **Modular Design**:
  - Split functions into separate modules based on their responsibilities:
    - `temperatureClassification.js`: Handles all temperature classification logic.
    - `alertHandler.js`: Manages alerting logic (controller and email alerts).
    - `typeWiseAlert.js`: Serves as the main entry point, importing and orchestrating other modules.
- **Result**: Easier to maintain and modify, with a clear separation of concerns.

### 2.5 Documentation and Comments

**Problem**  
There was limited documentation, making it difficult to understand the purpose of each function and module.

**Solution**  
- **Added JSDoc Comments**: Documented each function with input parameters, return values, and descriptions.
- **Result**: Improved readability and maintainability by providing context for each function's purpose and usage.

## 3. Future-Proofing and Extendibility

### Potential Features
- **Additional Alert Methods**: Easily add new alerting channels (e.g., SMS) by extending the `sendAlert` function with a new case.
- **Dynamic Temperature Limits**: Allow dynamic configuration of temperature limits via a configuration file or environment variables.
- **Customizable Alert Recipients**: Add flexibility to specify email recipients based on battery characteristics or severity.

### Ease of Extension
With the modular structure and refactored design, new features can be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

## 4. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Created unit tests for each function to validate individual functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Tested the interaction between modules, ensuring that alerts are correctly classified and handled.
- **Error Handling Tests**: Verified that the system properly throws errors for unknown inputs, ensuring reliability under unexpected conditions.

---

## 5. Results and Impact

- **Performance**: Reduced complexity led to faster execution, especially in temperature classification logic.
- **Reliability**: Improved error handling reduced the risk of unexpected runtime failures.
- **Maintainability**: Modular design and increased coverage made the code easier to modify and verify.
- **Readability**: JSDoc comments and modular structure improved the overall readability and understanding of the system.
